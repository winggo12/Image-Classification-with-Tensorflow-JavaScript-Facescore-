4.In this project , we use Keras to develop a custom model by the following tutorial on pyimagesearch (His website is good for learning computer vision tech.) . To develop your custom model , feel free to go to the link below. If you are wondering the way to turn .model file to .h5 and then to .tflite, please search online.
